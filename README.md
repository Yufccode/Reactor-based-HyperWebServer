# Reactor-based-HyperWebServer
A high-performance web server based on the multiplexer actor mode, with an underlying implementation using the epoll model

I will continue to update this project, continue to improve the backend and front-end issues, and create a complete project. So far, this project has completed the most basic backend construction and simple front-end construction.

**Among them, the basic principles of epoll in this project and the basic principles of multiplexing high-performance IO can be seen in my other repo.**
